**'FIND YOUR NEKO" Click Game**

The 'Find Your NEKO' click game is a web-based application that allows the user to play a picture matching game based on the character of their choosing from our local database. The local database has been populated through data retrieved from the nekos.best API (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).


**Guide for Installation**

Step One: Run your local json-server via your terminal (Instructions to download and run your server can be found (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)).
Step Two: Start up the index page by running 'open index.html' in a new terminal, separate from the terminal running the local json server.
Step Three: Enjoy your game!


**Basic Game Functionality**

The game is built as a "Where's Waldo"-styled picture matching game in which the user will designate the difficulty (total board size) and the character which they would like to search for. Once the aforementioned information is entered, the user will be prompted with their chosen character and the 'Find Me!" button to start the timer. The user will have the alotted time to find as many images that match their character as possible, incrementing their score along the way.

Do you have what it takes to beat your high score? Keep on playing till you do!

Complete with original song "Dance of the Cat Girls" from Ian Frankel (which can be turned on/off as desired).
